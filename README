# Purpose

This formula is used to install fail2ban and configure jail rules. Service-specific rules should be put in their own sub-state
to be included by the service.

# Usage

This should be a very modular formula, allowing for fine-grained includes.

``` myservice.sls
include:
  - fail2ban.myservice
```
